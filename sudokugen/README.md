# TODO:

## Finish Cleanup

Add tests to `solve.py`. Document `db.py`. Use `argparse` for `__main__.py`. Remove unnecessary dependencies using a fresh virtual env.

## Puzzle Generation

Create puzzles from scratch by assigning at least 17 cells in the beginning, with at least 8 distinct numbers.

## Evaluating Difficulty

Add an enhanced solver that implements human techniques in addition to brute-force backtracking. Given the technique used to solve each puzzle, we can create a metric measuring a puzzle's difficulty.

Techniques come from [here](http://www.sudokuoftheday.com/techniques/)
